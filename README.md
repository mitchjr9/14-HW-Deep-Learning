This repo contains my homework 14 assignments (lstm_stock_predictor_closing_prices.ipynb and lstm_stock_predictor_fng.ipynb) and the data used for the assignment (btc_historic.csv and btc_sentiment.csv).

The closing price predictor was far more accurate than the fear and greed predictor. This is plausible, as people's emotions often misconstrue their investing strategies. This is why Warren Buffet says "be greedy when others are fearful" and "the stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient". Thus, it is best to trust analysis and trends when investing rather than one's emotions.
